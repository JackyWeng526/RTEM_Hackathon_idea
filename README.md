## Open Source Building Datasets

In 2022, there is a Hackathon competition about building and energy held by [RTEM](https://www.rtemhackathon.com/).

During the competition, we can have approximately 200 buildings worth of time-series data from the RTEM database. 

The provided building meta data is shown as following:
